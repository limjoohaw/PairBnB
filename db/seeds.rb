# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
  
# 5.times do
 #  Listing.create ([{
	# name: Faker::Name.name,
	# property_type: Faker::Types.string,
	# phone: Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone,
	# country: Faker::Address.country,
	# num_room: rand(2..10),
	# price: rand(50..1000)
	# }])
